# Tkinter manager

Tkinter manager is a simple application designed to keep track of upcoming tasks and
events with a built-in calendar. The application was created as a credit program for the subject Programming 2 NPRG031 using the basic module for creating a graphical interface in the python language, Tkinter.

## Startup

if you want to be able to run the application from another location (eg from the desktop), run the create_alias.py file,
which creates a script that runs the application directly. You can move it to any location you choose
place.
